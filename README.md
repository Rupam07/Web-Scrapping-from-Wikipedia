# Web-Scrapping-from-Wikipedia

The python code here is used to extract the about the information of top cities in United States from Wikipedia. I have used Spyder to code and compile the code. Once the code is run the CSV file with the name "city" can be found under the same folder as that of the code. There are no additional steps required in order to run the code. 

The code compiles without any errors and successfully downloads the data of top cities in United States from Wikipedia into the CSV file.
